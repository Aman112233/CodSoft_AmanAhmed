# 🎥 Task 1: Movie Recommendation System  

This repository contains a **Movie Recommendation System** that suggests movies using both **content-based filtering** and **collaborative filtering**. It utilizes the **IMDB Movies Dataset** from Kaggle to generate personalized recommendations based on genres, ratings, and other features.  

---

## 📌 Features  
✅ **Content-Based Filtering** – Recommends movies similar to a given movie based on metadata such as genre, rating, and votes.  
✅ **Collaborative Filtering** – Suggests movies based on user-item interactions using IMDB ratings.  
✅ **Genre-Based Recommendations** – Retrieves top-rated movies within a specified genre.  
✅ **Scalable & Customizable** – Can be extended to include user preferences or hybrid methods.  

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used  
- **Python**  
- **Pandas** – Data handling and preprocessing  
- **NumPy** – Numerical computations  
- **Scikit-Learn** – TF-IDF vectorization and similarity calculations

# 🧑‍💻 Task 2: Face Detection and Recognition  
This project implements a **Face Detection and Recognition System** that detects faces in images and recognizes known faces using **OpenCV** and **face_recognition**.  

## 📌 Features  
✅ **Face Detection** – Detects faces in images using OpenCV’s Haar cascade model.  
✅ **Face Recognition** – Compares detected faces against known images using deep learning-based face encodings.  
✅ **Efficient & Scalable** – Works with multiple faces in an image or video feed.  
✅ **Image-Based Processing** – Works with images but can be extended to real-time video processing.

## 🛠 Technologies Used  
- **Python**  
- **OpenCV** – Used for image processing and Haar cascade face detection.  
- **face_recognition** – A deep-learning-based library for face encoding and comparison.

# 🤖 Task 3: Simple Rule-Based Chatbot
This repository contains a simple rule-based chatbot that responds to user inputs based on predefined rules and patterns. It uses basic natural language processing (NLP) techniques, including pattern matching with regular expressions, to provide relevant responses to various user queries.

## 📌 Features  
✅ **Pattern Matching** – Matches user inputs with predefined patterns to provide appropriate responses.  
✅ **Predefined Responses** – Responds to greetings, jokes, farewells, and general queries based on simple rules.  
✅ **Multiple Conversations** – Capable of handling a variety of interactions, including friendly conversations, jokes, and informational queries.  
✅ **Exit Option** – Allows the user to end the conversation by typing 'exit'.  
✅ **Simple and Interactive** – A basic implementation for beginners in NLP and chatbot development.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Python 3.x** – The base language used to develop the chatbot.
- **re (Regular Expressions)** – Used for pattern matching and detecting user input queries.
