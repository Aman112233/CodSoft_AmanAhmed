# **CodSoft Internship Tasks**

# 🎥 Task 1: Movie Recommendation System  

This repository contains a **Movie Recommendation System** that suggests movies using both **content-based filtering** and **collaborative filtering**. It utilizes the **IMDB Movies Dataset** from Kaggle to generate personalized recommendations based on genres, ratings, and other features.  

---

## 📌 Features  
✅ **Content-Based Filtering** – Recommends movies similar to a given movie based on metadata such as genre, rating, and votes.  
✅ **Collaborative Filtering** – Suggests movies based on user-item interactions using IMDB ratings.  
✅ **Genre-Based Recommendations** – Retrieves top-rated movies within a specified genre.  
✅ **Scalable & Customizable** – Can be extended to include user preferences or hybrid methods.  

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used  
- **Python**  
- **Pandas** – Data handling and preprocessing  
- **NumPy** – Numerical computations  
- **Scikit-Learn** – TF-IDF vectorization and similarity calculations

# 🏆 Task 2: Face Detection and Recognition  
This project implements a **Face Detection and Recognition System** that detects faces in images and recognizes known faces using **OpenCV** and **face_recognition**.  

## 📌 Features  
✅ **Face Detection** – Detects faces in images using OpenCV’s Haar cascade model.  
✅ **Face Recognition** – Compares detected faces against known images using deep learning-based face encodings.  
✅ **Efficient & Scalable** – Works with multiple faces in an image or video feed.  
✅ **Image-Based Processing** – Works with images but can be extended to real-time video processing.

## 🛠 Technologies Used  
- **Python**  
- **OpenCV** – Used for image processing and Haar cascade face detection.  
- **face_recognition** – A deep-learning-based library for face encoding and comparison.
